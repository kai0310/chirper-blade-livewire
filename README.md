## About

This project continues on the official [Laravel bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation) Blade version, adding [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) to the project.

My suggestion is that you first finish creating the application using Blade following the [official tutorial](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation) and then come back here. :) I tried to keep things as simple as possible, but I strongly suggest you first read the [Livewire documentation](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/quickstart).

Good luck and have fun!
